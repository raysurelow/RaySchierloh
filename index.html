        While I've never had the courage to play music in front of anyone I've off and on recorded music and had an interest in learning about songwriting and recording.  This is an album I wrote and recorded in 2016 called forward facing.  It's about embracing change instead of recoiling from it.  Cover is a photo I took on the street we lived on in Columbus at the time.
